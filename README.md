## Description:
The file Geometrija.nb contains functions for manipulating basic analytic geometric objects (vectors, points, lines, planes):
- presentation functions (canonical/vector equation of a line, equation of a plane etc.),
- construction functions (constructing a line through given points, a plane through three points etc.),
- property functions (finding angle or distance between planes, line, checking perpendicularity etc.),
- drawing functions (draw a set of objects such that all intersection points are visible),
- finding objects with given properties (e.g. find a plane which is perpendicular to given lines and contains a given point),
- other functions,
- examples showing how these functions can be used (a few standard undergraduate exercises).
Important note: the file is in Slovene.
